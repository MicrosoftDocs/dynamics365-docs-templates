# Template for concept articles

This article provides a template in Markdown code that you should use when you're writing a [concept](concept-guidance.md) article.

Before you start, make sure a concept is the [correct content type](content-type-comparison.md) for your article.

> [!TIP]
> This template is available in the INSERT EXTENSION NAME AND LINK HERE. To automatically create a new Markdown file with skeleton content and guidance, select **Template** from the Docs Markdown menu in VS Code, then select the appropriate template from the dropdown list.
