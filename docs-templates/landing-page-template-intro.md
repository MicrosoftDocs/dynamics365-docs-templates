# Template for landing pages

This article provides a template in YAML code that you should use when youâ€™re creating a [landing page](landing-page-guidance.md).

> [!TIP]
> This template is available in the INSERT EXTENSION NAME AND LINK HERE. To automatically create a new YAML file with skeleton content and guidance, select **Template** from the Docs Markdown menu in VS Code, then select the appropriate template from the dropdown list. For more information, see [How to use Docs templates](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/help/contribute/docs-authoring-pack#how-to-use-docs-templates).

If you prefer to write in GitHub, you can copy and paste the following YAML to start a landing page. Replace all instances of PLACEHOLDER TEXT (that is, text in ALL CAPS) with the appropriate value. Remember to delete all the comments before you commit to the source repository.
