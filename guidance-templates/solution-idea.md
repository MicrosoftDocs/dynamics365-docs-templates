# Article title as a scenario

*All descriptive text is formatted in italics to remind you to delete it before you complete and submit your solution. Your article can have only one **H1 heading (#)**, which is the article title. The H1 heading is always followed by a succinct descriptive paragraph that informs the reader what the article is about and how it can help them. Do not start the article with a note or tip.*

*This template is specific to **Dynamics 365 solution ideas**. Solution ideas are intended to be minimal architectures to only convey the basics of a given architecture that includes Dynamics 365.  Your article should be broken down into four subheadings (H2, ## in markdown)--Architecture, Scenario details, Contributors, and Next steps. The H2 headings and descriptions are included in this template. If you need to create a new heading under one of the H2 headings, use an H3 heading (###).*

***Completing the metadata:***
*This section provides guidance on completing the metadata section at the top of this template. Update the placeholder text based on the following guidance:*

- *title: Use the H1 (#) title of your article from the top of this section. Both titles should be identical. Maximum recommended length is 60 characters. If in doubt of the length, copy it to Word, and then use the Word count feature*
- *description: Provide a brief summary of your article. This is the description that appears in search engine results, so ensure the summary is clear and concise and attracts your intended audience. Maximum recommended length is 150-160 characters. If in doubt of the length, copy it to Word, and then use the Word count feature*
- *ms.date: Enter the date in mm/dd/yyyy format, as shown in the metadata field. Initially this should be the date your article is submitted. After publication, this field should be refreshed whenever the article is updated so readers can see that the content is fresh.*

*Introductory section with no heading*
*After the article title heading, include 1-2 sentences to briefly explain this solution. The full scenario info will go in the "Scenario details" section, which is below the "Architecture" H2 (top level) heading, below the "Alternatives" H3 header, and above the "Considerations" H2 (top level) header. That includes the "Potential use cases" H3 section, which goes under the "Scenario details" H2 section. The reason why we moved this content down lower, is because customers want the emphasis on the diagram and architecture first, not the scenario.*

## Architecture

*Architecture diagram goes here. Under the architecture diagram, include this sentence and a link to the Visio file or the PowerPoint file:*

Download a [PowerPoint file](https://github.com/microsoft/dynamics365patternspractices/) with this architecture.<!-- Change the link to point to your PowerPoint file>

### Dataflow

*An alternate title for this sub-section is "Workflow" (if data isn't really involved).*
*In this section, include a numbered list that annotates/describes the dataflow or workflow through the solution. Explain what each step does. Start from the user or external data source, and then follow the flow through the rest of the solution (as shown in the diagram).*

Examples:

1. Admin 1 adds, updates, or deletes an entry in Admin 1's fork of the Microsoft 365 config file.
2. Admin 1 commits and syncs the changes to Admin 1's forked repository.
3. Admin 1 creates a pull request (PR) to merge the changes to the main repository.
4. The build pipeline runs on the PR.

### Components

*A bullet list of components in the architecture (including all relevant Dynamics 365 and Azure services) with links to the product service pages.*  

*Why is each component there?*
*What does it do and why was it necessary?*
*Link the name of the service (via embedded link) to the service's product service page. Be sure to exclude the localization part of the URL (such as "en-US/").*

- Examples:

  - [Migrate Segmented Entry controls](https://learn.microsoft.com/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/financial/segmented-entry-control-conversion)
  - [Azure Bot Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/bot-service)

## Scenario details

*This should be an explanation of the business problem and why this scenario was built to solve it.*
*What prompted them to solve the problem?*
*What services were used in building out this solution?*
*What does this example scenario show? What are the customer's goals?*
*What were the benefits of implementing the solution?*

### Potential use cases

*What industry is the customer in? Use the following industry keywords, when possible, to get the article into the proper search and filter results: retail, finance, manufacturing, healthcare, government, energy, telecommunications, education, automotive, nonprofit, game, media (media and entertainment), travel (includes hospitality, like restaurants), facilities (includes real estate), aircraft (includes aerospace and satellites), agriculture, and sports.* 
*Are there any other use cases or industries where this would be a fit?*
*How similar or different are they to what's in this article?*

## Contributors

*(Expected, but this section is optional if all the contributors would prefer to not include it)*
*Start with the explanation text (same for every section), in italics. This makes it clear that Microsoft takes responsibility for the article (not the one contributor). Then include the "Pricipal authors" list and the "Additional contributors" list (if there are additional contributors). Link each contributor's name to the person's LinkedIn profile. After the name, place a pipe symbol ("|") with spaces, and then enter the person's title. We don't include the person's company, MVP status, or links to additional profiles (to minimize edits/updates). (The profiles can be linked to from the person's LinkedIn page, and we hope to automate that on the platform in the future). Implement this format with the explanation text formatted in italics:*

*Link to Learn articles, along with any third-party documentation.*
*Where should I go next if I want to start building this?*
*Are there any relevant case studies or customers doing something similar?*
*Is there any other documentation that might be useful? Are there product documents that go into more detail on specific technologies that are not already linked?*
