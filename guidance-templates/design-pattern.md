# Article title

*All descriptive text is formatted in italics to remind you to delete it before you complete and submit your design pattern. Your article can have only one **H1 heading (#)**, which is the article title. The H1 heading is always followed by a succinct descriptive paragraph that informs the reader what the article is about and how it can help them. Do not start the article with a note or tip.*

*This template is specific to **Dynamics 365 design patterns**. Your article should describe the problem that the pattern addresses, identify considerations for applying the pattern, and provide an example based on an implementation that includes Dynamics 365 apps. Most of the patterns include code samples or snippets that show how to implement the pattern. Your article should be broken down into six subheadings (H2, ## in markdown)--Context and problem, Solution, Issues and considerations, When to use this pattern, Example, and Next steps. The H2 headings and descriptions are included in this template. If you need to create a new heading under one of the H2 headings, use an H3 heading (###).*

***Completing the metadata:***
*This section provides guidance on completing the metadata section at the top of this template. Update the placeholder text based on the following guidance:*

- *title: Use the H1 (#) title of your article from the top of this section. Both titles should be identical. Maximum recommended length is 60 characters. If in doubt of the length, copy it to Word, and then use the Word count feature*
- *description: Provide a brief summary of your article. This is the description that appears in search engine results, so ensure the summary is clear and concise and attracts your intended audience. Maximum recommended length is 150-160 characters. If in doubt of the length, copy it to Word, and then use the Word count feature*
- *ms.date: Enter the date in mm/dd/yyyy format, as shown in the metadata field. Initially this should be the date your article is submitted. After publication, this field should be refreshed whenever the article is updated so readers can see that the content is fresh.*

*Introductory section with no heading*
*After the article title heading, include 1-2 sentences to briefly explain this pattern.*

## Context and problem

*Provide a brief background on the specific pattern and the problem that the pattern addresses.*

## Solution

*Describe the solution for the problem identified in the **Context and problem** section. If there are multiple solutions, put them in order of complexity and provide instructions on how the reader can choose the best solution for their given problem. Best practices are to provide a step-by-step approach to implement the solution, and to include screenshots to help guide the reader.*

## Issues and considerations

*Highlight pertinent concerns relevant to implementing the solution provided in the previous section. Best practices are to start this section with the following boilerplate sentence, followed by a bulleted list of topics for the reader to contemplate prior to implementing the given solution.*

This pattern might not be suitable:

- Item 1
- Item 2
